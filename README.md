<h1><b>LAFVIN Lamp</b></h1>  

Objective
Transform momentary button input into a toggle: each press switches LED ON or OFFâ€”and it stays in that state.

Implements button debounce: stabilizes the input to prevent multiple toggles from a single press.

Uses a logic toggle to maintain state between presses.
